Folder contains a project configured that I made today

You can firebase serve and it is all ready inside folder.

You can view data without creating an account and also with creating an account there is a button for both on the root index page.

I have not included persistant cache on this repo. 

Problem Statment: Safari is not displaying data at all with defaut settings for onSnapshot method while on other browsers data loads normally.
  =>To see this issue view either of the pages at /Users/data.html (logged in) or at /Users/noauthdata.html on local server.
